# Breathe-Mongolia

This repository contains data and analysis for air pollution in Mongolian cities.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive report on the state of air quality in Mongolian cities. We aim to track the levels of pollutants, rank cities on air quality, and provide recommendations for improving air quality.

## Data Sources

Our data comes from various sources, including government agencies, academic research, and citizen science initiatives. The air quality data is pulled from https://openaq.org/ and https://www2.purpleair.com/ API. The health and population data come from Mongoliaâ€™s National Statistics Office and the Center for Health and Development.
